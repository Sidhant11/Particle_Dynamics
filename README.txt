This C code extracts 3D particle positions and velocities as a function of time. Periodic boundary corrections are applied to the trajectories. The attached video in this folder uses the generated T.txt file for the dynamics visualization. Visualization code (Python) has been added to the Advanced_Visualizations folder.
